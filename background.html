        <h2 class="header">Interesting Story/Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>It was the winter of my freshman year and I had saved up enough money to buy what I had always wanted. A pony. I went with my mom to purchase the pony for about $10,000. I was overflowing with excitement as I brought home my dream. I named her Tiny. Unfortunetly, I slowly started to feel distant from Tiny. I kept her in my 2,000 square-foot yard. I fed her morsel of bread every other day and I allotted about a gallon of water a day. I noticed that her ribs were showing through. About a three months later I woke up in the morning to a rancid smell. I went out to check on Tiny and found her body shrivelled with flies encirculating her. That awful smell was from her decayed body. Two days later we buried her in my front lawn. I still wonder to this day, how did she possibly die?</p>
