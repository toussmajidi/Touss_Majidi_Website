    <p>I play for Marin FC soccer club. My goal is to play for one of the top universities for soccer. I started to play basketball for fun when the Warriors won the NBA Championship in 2015. I love playing FIFA with my brother and my cousins. We always play tournaments to see who really is the best. I love going to my uncle's or grandma's house to eat their delcious food. I am always ready from some good grub.</p>
